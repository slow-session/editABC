# editABC

A simple ABC editor which uses some of the code from the https://wellington.session.nz webpages which you can find at

* https://github.com/slow-session/wellington.session.nz

You can access the editor at https://editabc.session.nz

It's constructed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which means that once you've loaded the page, all the necessary bits to make it work will be cached in your browser so that the page will work even if you're offline.

You can also use the <b>Add to Home screen</b> option on Android phones and get similar behaviour there.
